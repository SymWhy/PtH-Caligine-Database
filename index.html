<p>The Appear Charms change your appearance, and produce other illusions. Seekers and Troubadours
    have affinity for them.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Flair Emotion (Appear •)</button>
<div class="content">
<p><b>Action:</b> Instant<br>
<b>Dice Pool:</b> Unrolled<br>
<b>Cost:</b> 1 Wisp<br>
<b>Duration:</b> Lasting</p>
    <p>The Princess takes a Wisp’s worth of emotional energy and releases it into the air. To psychic empaths,
    Princesses using Passion’s Light, and similar abilities it shines like a flair and can be used as a signal.
    Usually no roll is required, the Princess spends the Wisp and barring a large distraction any empath in
    the area will notice, but a Composure + Empathy roll may be used to get into the right emotional state
    if the Nakama have agreed to use specific emotions as specific signals.
    An alternative use for this Charm is to release the Wisp in close proximity to an empath, this hits
    like a flashbang and triggers a Presence + Empathy vs Composure + Supernatural advantage roll. If
    the Princess wins the roll she inflicts an appropriate Tilt for either a turn or one turn per success. The
    Tilt chosen depends on how the target senses emotions and the duration depends on the severity of the
    Tilt. A character who hears emotions might take Stunned for one turn, or Deafened for several turns.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Grey Masquerade (Appear •)</button>
<div class="content">
<p><b>Action:</b> Instant<br>
<b>Dice Pool:</b> Manipulation + Empathy<br>
<b>Cost:</b> 1 Wisp<br>
<b>Duration:</b> 24 hours</p>
    <p>Princesses enjoy powerful protection to keep their secret identity secret but not everyone is so lucky.
        Beacons cannot hide the unusual amount of Light they produce by storing it inside a Transformed self.
        Sworn are visibly under an enchantment. So helpful Princesses can use this Charm to disguise the signs.
        After all, if your goal is to give your sister the magic she needs to fly away from danger painting a target
        on her back defeats the purpose.
        This Charm can only be used on Beacons, Sworn, or Shikigami. It is commonly known by Shikigami
        who travel independently to seek out Princesses to mentor.</p>
        <div class="failsucc"><i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Princess accidentally sends out a flair of magic, perceivable over a reasonable
        distance by anyone who can sense such things.<br>
        <i>Failure:</i> The target’s supernatural nature raiment.<br>
        <i>Success:</i> The target takes the Masquerade Condition, any passive supernatural power which would
        detect their supernatural nature, such as the Charm Reflected Light, will automatically fail. Active
        supernatural powers, such as the Charm A Magical Girl’s Eyes, must overcome a Clash of Wills against
        whoever invoked this Charm. If it cannot overcome the illusion the target registers as a completely
        normal human (or a completely normal something else in the case of Shikigami). This Charm provides
        no protection to active uses of power by the Charm’s subject. If a Sworn activates his Practical Magic
        near someone with Reflected Light they will feel it as normal.<br>
        <i>Exceptional Success:</i> The duration lasts a whole week.</div>
        <p><b>Upgrade: Close the Third Eye (Acqua ••)</b><br>
        By studying esoteric lore of the human mind the Princess can learn to shield a mortal psychic’s
        signature. This changes the Dicepool to Wits + Occult, apart from that the Charm works as normal.<br></p>
        <p><b>Upgrade: Grand Ballroom</b><br>
        <b>Cost: +1 Willpower</b><br>
        The Princess can mask the enchantments she or another Princess created, hiding it from discovery
        through abilities like A Magical Girl’s Eyes. She could invoke Grand Ballroom upon artwork enchanted
        by Living Image, a character under the effects of a Bless Charm, an inanimate object with the Held 
        Charm Condition, or any other magic that lingers after the invocation of a Charm, Privilege, or Edict.
        As with regular uses of Grey Masquerade the illusion can be penetrated through a Clash of Wills.
        If the Charm the Princess wishes to hide works on a Sanctuary scale the roll becomes an Extended
        Action with a target number equal to twice the Sanctuary’s size. If the Princess hides the Consecrated
        Condition then the duration extends until the end of the Consecrated Condition and it will hide all
        Charms that are built atop the Condition.<br></p>
        <p><b>Upgrade: Gold Masque (Aria ••)</b><br>
        <b>Cost: +2 Wisps</b><br>
        The Princess’ ability to mask a supernatural nature grows more potent, strong enough to hide a
        Transformed Princess.<br></p>
        <p><b>Upgrade: Perennial Veils (Lacrima •••)</b><br>
        <b>Cost: +1 Willpower Dot</b><br>
        The Charm’s Duration extends to Indefinite.<br></p>
        <p><b>Upgrade: Funerary Masque (Lacrima ••••)</b><br>
        The Princess’ twists her ability to conceal the supernatural, and instead conceals the mundane from
        supernatural eyes. Any supernatural being must make a Clash of Wills in order to notice the target.
        If they fail the contest they will only remember the target as a generic unimportant person and will
        never directly interact with them. A hungry Darkspawn who’s willing to eat any human it can find
        will fail to consider the target even if no other options are available. Princesses are a special case to
        this rule, Funerary Masque has no effect upon them in their mundane form, but applies while they are
        in their Transformed identity.</p>
       <p>Funerary Masque can only be invoked upon Mortals and Beacons.</p><br>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Light The Way (Appear •)</button>
<div class="content">
<p><b>Action:</b> Instant<br>
<b>Dice Pool:</b> Unrolled<br>
<b>Cost:</b> 1 Wisp<br>
<b>Duration:</b> Inner Light or Invocation Hours</p>
The Princess can, at any time, create a soft light that banishes the thickest natural darkness. The light source can take any source the princess wishes, from a torch or a glowing halo to a simple ambient glow. She can bring the light up or douse it reflexively, and set it to shine at any intensity short of full sunlight. The Noble can also focus the light to a bright, narrow beam into someone’s eyes to inflict temporary blindness. This is a normal attack using Dexterity + Athletics, and the target’s Defense applies. On a normal success the target is Blinded [CofD 281] in one eye; on an exceptional success he is Blinded in both eyes. Either way, the Tilt lasts for one turn.
<br/></p>
<p><b>Upgrade: Dazzling (Fuoco •)</b>
<br/>
The Noble can reflexively make her light burn at a constant eye-watering intensity, blinding anyone nearby who looks at her, by spending a Wisp. Anyone who can see her must succeed on a Stamina + Composure roll, penalized by the Noble’s Fuoco, or be Blinded in one eye until he looks away from her, or she dims her light again, whichever comes first.
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Gone With The Wind (Appear • Aria •)</button>
<div class="content">
<p><b>Action:</b> Reflexive<br>
<b>Dice Pool:</b> Dexterity + Stealth vs Wits + Composure<br>
<b>Cost:</b> 1 Wisp<br>
<b>Duration:</b> Lasting</p>
<p>For a few crucial seconds the Princess becomes elusive and all eyes slide off her. This Charm may be
    invoked reflexively when someone is attempting to track or follow the Princess. Each subsequent attempt
    to use this Charm on the same person in a scene grants a cumulative +3 bonus to their Contesting roll.</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Princess attracts attention. The target may reroll to track the Princess and
    takes the better result.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> The Princess’ appearance and raiment are unchanged.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The target is suddenly dazed and cannot spot the Princess, he must scramble to find her
    again. All successes on his last roll are removed but he may try again the next turn, assuming the
    Princess hasn’t used this that time to vanish. If the Princess is attempting to pick the target’s pocket,
    or some similar instant action, this essentially gives her a second try at a Contested roll. If the target
    beats her mundane roll then so long as she has a single Success she can use this Charm to erase her
    opponents successes and win the mundane roll.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> In addition to the usual effects the Princess’ first Stealth roll in the next few
    turns gains 8again.
</div>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">A Minute of Silence (Appear • Lacrima •)</button>
<div class="content">
<p><b>Action:</b> Reflexive, unrolled or Instant<br>
<b>Dice Pool:</b> Dexterity + Stealth vs Wits + Composure<br>
<b>Cost:</b> 1 Wisp<br>
<b>Duration:</b> 1 scene</p>
<p>The Princess spends a wisp and shrouds herself in science. All attempts to locate her by listening fail
    automatically, though the right supernatural power may trigger a Clash of Wills. Moreover, she may
    spend a Wisp and roll Dexterity + Stealth vs Wits + Composure to make an object or person she touches
    totally silent for a number of turns to her Lacrima.</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> A banshee like wail emanates from somewhere close to the Princess for a turn.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> Nothing happens.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The Princess inflicts the Silenced Tilt on her target.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> If targeting a living being the Princess also inflicts the Shaken Tilt through the
    sheer wrongness of not being able to hear one’s own body.
</div>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Tranquillise (Appear • Legno •)</button>
<div class="content">
<p><b>Action:</b> Instant<br>
<b>Dice Pool:</b> Composure + Survival<br>
<b>Cost:</b> 1 Wisp<br>
<b>Duration:</b> 1 scene</p>
<p>The Princess wraps herself in an illusion of a peaceful glade.</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Princess takes the Sensory Overload Condition and is considered to be in an
    uncomfortable environment until the scene ends.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> Nothing happens.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> For the remainder of the scene, or until she ends the Charm, the Princess can hear nothing
    but a gentle stream in the distance, she smells nothing but a spring breeze, and the temperature feels
    cool and dry. If the environment is extreme enough to cause actual harm the Princess will still feel
    pain even though she feels like she is at a comfortable temperature. This Charm is usually used to
    remove situational penalties when trying to study, meditate, or fall asleep.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> For the duration of the Charm the Princess takes the Blessing Condition and
    adds +2 to all meditation rolls.
</div>
<b>Drawback: </b>The Princess takes the Deafened tilt for the duration of the Charm, and cannot smell either.
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Zephyr's Track (Appear • Aria •)</button>
<div class="content">
<p><b>Action:</b> Instant<br>
<b>Dice Pool:</b> Dexterity + Stealth<br>
<b>Cost:</b> 1 Wisp<br>
<b>Duration:</b> Scene/Lasting</p>
<p>The Noble floats through the world like a breeze, leaving no trace of her passing except by her own will.</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Noble becomes clumsy, prone to slip and make noise when she wants to hide.
    She takes a -2 penalty on all Stealth dice pools until the scene ends.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> The Noble leaves traces of herself behind her as usual.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> Gentle puffs of air follow the Noble, cleaning away any traces the Noble leaves in the wake
    of her movements. Footprints and fingerprints are brushed away; hairs and skin cells float behind her
    without settling; drops of sweat or blood evaporate. Any attempt to follow her trail or deduce her
    actions from physical evidence fails. This wind follows the Princess for one scene, but it’s effects are
    Lasting.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> The Noble can choose to leave false evidence behind her that suggests a person
    quite unlike herself passed where she has gone.
</div>
<p><b>Upgrade: Multiple</b><br>
Modified by commonality.<br>
The breezes can clear away traces of many people at once. The Noble uses the Charm on the members
of an organization she can see, using the Commonalty modifier. If she succeeds, all traces of their
passing are erased.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Phantom (Appear ••)</button>
<div class="content">
<p><b>Action:</b> Instant<br>
<b>Dice Pool:</b> Wits + Expression<br>
<b>Cost:</b> 1 Wisp<br>
<b>Duration:</b> 1 scene</p>
<p>The Princess forms a Wisp into an illusory object. The illusion affects only sight, and material objects
    pass through it without stopping. The Size of the image is limited to 2 + Inner Light or any applied
    Invocation, but within that limit she can show any image she is capable of imagining.</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Charm fails with a burst of light and a loud crack, alerting anyone nearby who
    could see or hear to the Princess’s presence.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> No image appears.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The Princess creates the image she desires, somewhere within her sensory range. The image
    remains until the Charm ends. The Princess may manipulate the image for no cost, for example
    she could make an illusionary person walk around but could not turn it into an illusionary car. This
    requires her full attention, if a roll is required the dicepool is Wits + Expression though the Storyteller
    may nominate a different dicepool if the situation warrants it. E.G. Wits + Subterfuge to make an
    illusionary person decieve someone. Intelligence + Academics to create an illusionary chalkboard with
    accurate scientific equations.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> The Princess manipulates her illusion deftly. Her mundane actions to control it
    gain a +2 bonus.
</div>
<p><b>Upgrade: Dancing</b><br>
    The Princess may create an image that moves without her conscious attention. When her concentration
    lapses, the image continues to act on the instructions she last gave it.</p>
<p><b>Upgrade: Glowing</b><br>
    Requires Light the Way<br>
    The Princess can make her illusions give off light, just as her Regalia does with Light the Way. As long
as she is concentrating on an image, she may vary the light coming from it reflexively, independently
of her personal light. If she has upgraded Light the Way, she may apply all that Charm’s upgrades to
the image’s light as if it were her own.</p> 
<p><b>Upgrade: Consecrated</b><br>
    The Princess may sustain a Lasting illusion with the blessing of a Consecrated area. Doing to keeps
the illusion intact until the Consecrated Condition ends, but limits its movements to the area covered
by the Condition.</p>   
<p><b>Upgrade: Singing</b><br>
    The Princess may create an illusory sound, or add sound to an illusory image. A sound without an
image seems to come from any point the Princess can see, which she can move while concentrating.</p>
<p><b>Upgrade: Solid</b><br>
    The image becomes substantial. As long as it lasts it has a degree of solidity, as well as a firmness and
texture appropriate to what it depicts. However, just because it projects an image of solidity does not
mean it is solid; the image shatters if force is applied to it (by kicking an illusionary wall, for example)
or with it (an illusionary wrench won’t tighten or loosen a bolt).</p>  
<p><b>Upgrade: Thinking (Acqua ••)</b><br>
    Requires Dancing<br>
When the Princess releases her concentration, in addition to providing the illusion with further
instructions she may grant it a measure of adaptability. For each dot of Acqua she may instruct the
image to recognise one condition and react in response. The illusion has mundane senses within the
human range. If a roll is required the illusion has a dicepool equal to the Princess’ Acqua, for an
illusionary watchman who sounds the alarm when someone approaches and could roll Acqua to
contest stealth.</p>  
<p><b>Upgrade: Multiplied (Aria ••)</b><br>
Requires Dancing<br>
The Princess may create multiple distinct images with a single Charm activation. She can make one
image for each dot of her Aria; for each image beyond the first, the maximum Size of all the images
is reduced by 1. The Princess can try to control more than one image at once but takes a -2 penalty
to her dice pool for each image beyond the first. If she applies Singing, each image may have its own
sound and images can be replaced with sounds, but the number of distinct illusions remains limited
to her Aria.</p>  
<p><b>Upgrade: Scented (Legno ••)</b><br>
The Princess may create an illusory scent, or add scent to an illusory image or sound. If the image
is Solid, she can give it a taste as well. A scent without an image seems to come from a point the
Princess can see, which she can move while concentrating.</p> 
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Face of Lover's Alarm (Appear •• Specchio ••)</button>
<div class="content">
<p><b>Action:</b> Reflexive<br>
<b>Dice Pool:</b> Manipulation + Empathy vs Wits + Composure<br>
<b>Cost:</b> 1 Wisp<br>
<p>One would not threaten a loved one, would they? And as the Queen of Mirrors teaches, the True Heir
will be beloved by all. This Charm is activated in response to an attack before the target rolls and the
Princess must be able to apply her Defence to the attack.</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The target sees the Noble as a perverted mockery of one they love, and gain +3
    dice on their attack roll. They cannot be affected by this Charm for the reminder of the scene.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> The target sees through the illusion and cannot be affected by this Charm for the reminder
    of the scene.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The Noble’s face shifts into someone the target loves and they are compelled to react
    appropriately, pulling their blow aside before the Princess can be hurt. The wasted attack still
    consumes their action for the turn. They also take the Blessing Condition and gain +3 dice to resist
    this Charm for the remainder of the scene.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> As above, and the target takes some small Tilt. They might unbalance themselves
    and take Knocked Down. 
</div>
<p><b>Upgrade: Inviolate (Specchio •••)</b><br>
    <b>Cost:</b> +1 Willpower<br>
    Just as the Princess shifts into someone the target loves, someone else in reach of the target’s weapon
takes the Princess’ form. The Princess nominates another person within range of the attacker’s weapon,
if she wins the Contested roll the target must attack them instead.
</p>
<p><b>Upgrade: Doomed (Specchio ••••)</b><br>
    <b>Cost:</b> +1 Willpower<br>
    Does the mirror reflect the truth, or does it show things how they should be? If the individual whom
the Noble mimics is present, and within the attack range of the form of weapon used to attack her, the
attack is transferred to them. If the Princess wins the contested roll the target must make an attack
roll against the her, subtracting her Defence as normal, but the damage goes to their loved one. In
the case of a melee weapon, the target might swing wide and hit their friend; for a ranged weapon, it
can be more improbable, as ricochets, arcing electrical conduits, and exploding fire extinguishers all
conspire to hurt their ally. If the loved one has armour or similar protections they apply as normal.

<p>The movements of the Princess’ body are saturated by meaning. She uses this Charm on a single
    individual who can see her.</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Noble destroys her natural ability to communicate. All her Expression rolls
    take a -2 penalty for the rest of the scene.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> The Noble’s gestures convey no special meaning.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The Noble can convey the most complicated thoughts to her target with a turn of the head, a
    twist of the hand, or a facial expression, as quickly as with normal speech; the target will understand
    her intent even if he shares no languages with her, as long as they can see her. Nobody else looking
    at her will understand her meaning; indeed, unless onlookers examine her carefully (succeeding on an
    Intelligence + Investigation roll) they won’t realize that she is “saying” anything at all. The Charm
    does not help the Noble understand the target.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> The Noble may combine her gestures with her speech. Her Expression rolls to
    communicate with the target gain a +2 bonus until the Charm ends.
</div>
<p><b>Upgrade: Collective (Acqua ••)</b><br>
    Modified by Commonalty<br>
The Princess can convey her thoughts to members of an organization that can see her, using the
Commonalty modifier. Those not in the organization will not understand her gestures.

<b>Cost:</b> 1 Wisp<br>
<b>Duration:</b> Lasting</p>
<p>The Princess encodes a message into a seemingly innocuous display. First she must create a physical
    display to contain her message, and it could be anything. She could arrange her collection of stuffed
    toys into a symbolic order, or write a letter with a second coded message. Then she names the recipient
    or recipients. She may choose one person, a group (applying a Commonality modifier), a Court or the
    Nobility as a whole (at -5).</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Princess message is not hidden as well as she thinks. At some point in the
    future the Storyteller should introduce a problem caused by it falling into the wrong hands.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> The charm fails to activate.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The Princess creates a message which contains roughly as much information as one minute’s
    worth of speech per success. Regular speech, not the Royal Tongue. When any of the intended
    recipients examines the object containing they immediately know it is significant. No roll is necessary
    to decode the message but some time and attention might be. If the object is destroyed or significantly
    modified or damaged the hidden message is lost. If the message falls into the hands of anyone but the
    intended recipient they will not be able to decrypt it without magic and a Clash of Wills.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> The Princess may optionally add a duration to the magic, just encase it falls into
    the hands of a magical opponent.

<p>Sometimes a Princess just needs to wow a crowd. With this Charm a Princess can summon her own
    support team with a maximum of Inner Light members.
    Before casting Summon Backup Dancers the Princess must declare what kind of action they’re going
    to support. The Princess could declare singing in which case they’d be able to perform dance routines or
    backup vocals. The Princess could declare painting and summon a model to paint. The backup dancers
    primary task must involve giving some sort of performance, she cannot summon a team of stage hands
    and set them wiring up her stage.</p>
    <p>Backup dancers are solid but only when performing the task they were created, an actor would be
    able to interact with props, and wear costumes, but would not be able to fetch a cup of coffee. A cunning
    Princess might still be able to use them for other roles, she might ask her trope to dance around waving
    their arms in front of her enemies face while she hides, or to attack foes who don’t realise the backup
    dancers cannot hurt them. (Assume a 1 die pool on any social actions, mental and physical tasks fail
    automatically). If attacked a single point of Damage, even Bashing, causes a Backup dancer to vanish
    into a puff of ephemera appropriate to the Princess.</p>
    <p>A Princess can only have one instance of Summon Backup Dancers active at a time.</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> You summon Inner Light performers but have no control over them. They
    immediately run riot, while not actually harmful they can be very very annoying and are certainly
    inappropriate to the Princesses wishes. Think clowns, not monsters.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> No dancers appear.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The Noble creates several assistants. The crew acts as equipment for the chosen task, giving
    an equipment bonus equal to the Successes rolled (maximum of 5) to the Noble, or to anyone else she tells them to help. However, they carry the Volatile Condition [CofD 102]. If the Princess performs
    badly her backup will follow her lead, potentially following her off a metaphorical cliff.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> The crew doesn’t flake out when their principal blunders. They don’t carry the
    Volatile Condition

<div class="content">
<p><b>Action:</b> Instant<br>
<b>Dice Pool:</b> Intelligence + Crafts<br>
<b>Cost:</b> 2+ Wisp<br>
<b>Duration:</b> Variable</p>
<p>“I can’t be in two places at once!” is an all-too-common complaint from just about anyone; the Hopeful
    especially find it necessary to be two people at once, when mundane obligations interfere with fighting
    a supernatural incursion. With this Charm a Princess can partly resolve such dilemmas, by making a
    facsimile of her mundane self that moves and speaks, and can pass as herself if not examined too closely.
    To use the Charm, the Princess must have a mass of material that she can shape barehanded, or else
    a quantity of fluid, of roughly Size 2. Infusing this material with Wisps, she transforms it into an Astral
    Droplet: an exact physical copy of herself just before her last transformation, wearing identical clothing.
    The Droplet has the same mundane Attributes and Skills as its creator, and access to all her memories
    as of the time of its creation. However, it lacks energy and imagination; it does not get 10-again on
    any dice pool, or any other quality that allows rerolling dice, cannot spend Willpower, and has neither
    Virtue nor Vice. The Droplet is also fragile - a single point of damage of any type is enough to dissolve
    it into the stuff it was made of and glimmers of light. Finally, the Droplet has none of the Princess’
    Light-derived powers, not even Practical Magic.</p>
    <p>The Droplet’s basic duration is 30 minutes for each activation success. The Princess may choose to
    extend the duration by spending more Wisps than the minimum of 2 - each extra Wisp doubles the
    time before the Droplet disintegrates, cumulatively. She cannot, however, spend more Wisps for this
    purpose than half her Inner Light, rounded up. She may choose the total number of Wisps spent after
    the activation roll, though she must spend at least 2. She may end the Charm prematurely by touching
    the Droplet and concentrating for a turn. A Princess cannot create a second Droplet before the first
    Droplet dissolves - the Charm just fails if she tries.</p>
    <p>By default the Droplet is an automaton which follows any instruction given to it which does not
    pose a threat of physical harm, and otherwise stays wherever it is put; it takes no action on its own. If
    the material used to make it resonates with an Invocation the Princess may apply that Invocation to
    the Charm (Aria uses thick mist or smoke, or a strong breeze, Lacrima can use total darkness or dark
    shadow.) Droplets so formed have some initiative and the rudiments of a personality; in the absence of
    clear instructions they follow the tenets of the applied Invocation, to the extent allowed by the knowledge
    and abilities the Princess possesses.</p>
<p><b>Upgrade: Integrated</b><br>
It’s often useful to know what your double has been doing during your absence. If the Princess dissolves
her Droplet prematurely by touching it and concentrating, she can recall to memory a description of
the actions the Droplet took and the events it saw and heard. A roll to recall any detail of the account
is at -2 in addition to any other penalties.
</p>
<p><b>Upgrade: Lifelike (Specchio •••)</b><br>
A Lightbringer can use that indescribable quality that makes her reflection “her reflection”instead of
a simple image and use it to place mind and will into the Droplets they make. To apply Lifelike the
Princess needs a reflecting surface large enough to hold an image of her upper body; she takes the
hands of her image and pulls it out of the surface. The resulting Droplet is flipped left-to-right, and
with the opposite dominant hand. The real difference though, is that the Droplet gains a nearly-human
initiative and will; it has the Belief dots, Virtues and Vice of its creator, gets 10-again on its dice pools,
can benefit from other qualities that permit rerolls, and may spend and regain Willpower (though it
begins with none.) The only supernatural ability the Droplet possesses is the ability to Transform and benefit from Transformed skills and attributes, created by Specchio it possesses the Queen of Mirror’s
Practical Magic. The first time the Princess creates this Droplet, its personality exactly matches her
own (including any forms of madness) and aside from the physical inversion they can’t be told apart.</p>
<p><b>Drawback: </b>By invoking a Lifelike a Princess is summoning an independent being. The Droplet’s
personality does not vanish when its body dissolves; it returns to being her reflection, until she makes
another Lifelike Droplet. At that moment it returns and inhabits the new-made body. Since the
droplet is created from a reflection it sees nothing wrong with going back behind the mirror (and finds
acting independently a bit weird and uncomfortable, but nobody said being a Princess or her reflection
was easy). However every time the Princess invokes Lifelike there is a chance that Specchio’s madness
will infect her Droplet. Each time it inhabits a new body the Droplet rolls Resolve + Composure,
with a -2 penalty if the Princess is suffering from Specchio induced madness. If she fails, the Droplet’s
falls to Specchio’s arrogance; she is convinced of her excellence and her right to rule, and resents the
Princess taking her rightful limelight. The Droplet will do what it can to avoid returning to behind
the mirror. It can lengthen the Charm’s duration by spending its own Willpower; it may spend 1
point each day for this, which adds 24 hours of continued embodiment. (The Droplet cannot do this
if the Resolve + Composure check succeeds.)</p>
<p>Just what the Droplet does is up to the Storyteller, but it should avoid Compromising the Princess’
own Beliefs.</p>
<p>If the Princess applies Integrated and Lifelike, all her memories since the Droplet’s first creation become
available to it on the same terms as its are available to her after she dissolves it. Other than that,
neither personality can remember what the other has done.

<div class="content">
<p><b>Action:</b> Instant<br>
<b>Dice Pool:</b> Manipulation + Stealth<br>
<b>Cost:</b> 1 Wisp<br>
<b>Duration:</b> 1 scene</p>
<p>The Princess shies out of view entirely. She becomes both physically invisible and mentally invisible as
    people find themselves incapable of focusing on evidence of her activities. If she opens a door and walks
    through nobody will notice the door move, though they may unconsciously move to avoid being hit by
    the door.</p>
<p>Any use of Charms ends this power, as does Swords or Tears’ Practical Magic. Any act of violence,
    or any act that could be described as “attention grabbing” such as yelling or jumping up and down while
    waving your arms ends the effect.</p>
<p>This protection extends to anyone viewing a recording or photo of the Princess that is both made and
    viewed during the current scene. However once the Charm ends so does her psychic invisibility, meaning
    that evidence of her activity will no longer be ignored. If she is caught on camera opening a door then
    once the Charm ends anyone reviewing the footage will see a door mysteriously open by itself.</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Noble makes herself memorable without realizing it. She takes the Inverse
    Curse Condition, all Perception rolls to notice her take a +2 bonus for the rest of the scene.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> Nothing happens.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The Princess stops emitting any light in the visible spectrum and clouds the minds of any who
    might notice her regardless. She is essentially impossible to notice with mundane senses. Supernatural
    senses allow a Clash of Wills roll to penetrate the Princess’ invisibility. A mortal who suspects
    the Princess is present my track her by looking for footsteps, opening doors, or other evidence of her
    passing. This requires an Extended Wits + Investigation roll with a target of the Princess’ Composure
    + Stealth + Inner Light. Even with useful equipment like an infra-red camera it will take a while for
    the tracker to force his mind to except that heat patch is the Princess and not a glitch or passer by.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> The Princess can shout and wave her arms as much as she wants. Unless she
    intends for someone to notice her the Charm will not end. Violence, Charms and Swords or Tear’s
    practical magic will still end the Charm.
</div>
<p><b>Upgrade: Collective</b><br>
    The Princess can hide an entire group by applying the Commonality modifier.
</p>
<p><b>Upgrade: Veiled</b><br>
    Using another Charm does not automatically end this Charm, though the results of the Charm are
not masked, neither are any flashes or sparkles created as a side effect.
</p>
<p><b>Upgrade: Full Spectrum (Acqua ••)</b><br>
    The Princess’ invisibility extends into the infra-red and ultra-violet spectrum. In addition the mental
effects of the Charm extend to affect mundane technology, making her all but invisible to all
technological means. A door that is set to issue an alarm when it is opened will remain silent unless
the Princess leaves it open when the charm ends or someone else jostles it.

    <i>Success:</i> The target is fooled by the illusion. The effects of this Charm depend on what the target
    was planning to do. A sword stroke is entirely wasted but throwing a grenade at the illusion might
    still catch the real person in the blast. If the target is using a gun capable of Autofire she could easily
    shoot at both to be on the safe side.<br>

<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Princess gives pain only to herself. For the rest of the scene she suffers a -1

    <i>Failure:</i> The target ignores the Princess’ pain.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The target suffers phantom bashing damage, equal to the number of boxes with damage of
    any type on the Princess’ Health track or his unmarked Health boxes, whichever is less. The target
    suffers wound penalties from this damage if it goes into the last three boxes, and must check their
    Stamina to remain conscious if it fills the last box, as normal. However, the damage is not real; it
    vanishes when the Charm ends as if it were healed, and if the target takes real bashing damage when
    the track is full, that damage replaces the phantom damage instead of wrapping into lethal damage.
    Phantom damage also has no effect if the target has no empty Health Boxes to fill. The phantom
    damage can also be healed magically, or mitigated as it’s inflicted by targets who have that ability.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> The phantom damage from the Charm is lethal. The target does not bleed out
    if the phantom damage incapacitates him, and real lethal damage replaces it instead of wrapping into
    aggravated damage.

    doesn’t beat the target’s successes, he realizes that this person is an illusion within moments. If she
    does get more successes, the target will treat the imaginary person as fully real, and respond to it as
    to a person of the role the Noble chose. No one else - including the Noble - will see or hear the

    <i>Success:</i> When the Princess reaches the threshold, the appearance of every nonliving thing in the
    targeted area is transformed to match a theme the Princess chooses. (For instance, “formal ballroom”,
    “open bazaar”, “African jungle” and “undersea grotto” are all valid themes.) Permanent fixtures
    are always changed; she can choose whether to change people’s possessions, but cannot affect some
    possessions and not others. As long as the Charm lasts, the changed objects look, sound, feel and even
    smell like what they appear to be; observers may make Perception rolls to spot something wrong with
    the illusion, but they take a penalty equal to the Princess’ successes.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> If the Princess scores an Exceptional Success on her extended roll then mundane

<div class="content">
<p><b>Action:</b> Instant<br>
<b>Dice Pool:</b> Variable<br>
<b>Cost:</b> 2 Wisps<br>
<b>Duration:</b> 1 scene</p>
<p>Charms of Enhancement are a set of Charms that provide the Blessing Condition adding Activation
    Successes, up to a maximum of the relevant Invocation, in dots to one of the target’s Attributes for a
    scene. A character cannot benefit from two invocations of the same Charm of Enhancement at the same
    time, and an Attribute can never be enhanced above the (Princess’ maximum Transformed Attribute +
    5). The Charms are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Drawn by the Moon (Acqua ••):</b> Roll : Intelligence + Science to enhance a Mental Attribute.</li>
        <li><b>Wind-Borne Grace (Aria ••):</b> Roll Presence + Expression to enhance a Finesse Attribute.</li>
        <li><b>Stoke the Furnace (Fuoco ••):</b> Roll Strength + Persuasion to enhance a Power Attribute.</li>
        <li><b>Forest Sanctuary (Legno ••):</b> Roll Stamina + Survival to enhance a Resistance Attribute.</li>
        <li><b>Crown Jewels (Terra ••):</b> Roll Manipulation + Persuasion to enhance a Social Attribute.</li>
        <li><b>Sic Semper Proditor (Lacrima ••):</b> Roll Presence + Intimidation to apply the Cursed
            Condition and reduce a Social Attribute. An Attribute cannot be reduced below one.</li>
        <li><b>Avenger’s Might (Tempesta ••):</b> Tempesta’s Charm of Enhacement does not enhance an
            Attribute. Instead Roll Resolve + Brawl to enhance every roll in combat.</li>
        <li><b>Regiis Gloria (Specchio •••):</b> Roll Presence + Expression and split the Successes among
            any Attribute. No attribute can be raised by more than Specchio dots. A Princess can only invoke
            Regiis Gloria upon herself, and she may enhance the benefit with another Charm of Enhancement.</li>
    </ul>

<p><b>Upgrade: Flexible (Invocation •••)</b><br>
    The Noble may add dots to all of the target’s Attributes within the Charm’s purview. She distributes
her successes across the Attributes; she still cannot add more than her Invocation to any one Attribute.
This Upgrade must be purchased separately for each Charm of Enhancement and cannot be acquired
for Regiis Gloria.

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Light’s Aegis (Bless •••)</button>
<div class="content">
<p><b>Action:</b> Instant<br>
<b>Dice Pool:</b> Presence + Resolve<br>
<b>Cost:</b> 2 Wisps<br>
<b>Duration:</b> 1 scene</p>
<p>The Princess extends a portion of her mantle over another person, granting him the power to ward off
    injuries. The Charm may not be used on anyone currently affected by it or anyone who has been affected
    by it in the current scene.</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Princess mishandles her power and injures herself. She takes 1 resistant lethal
    damage.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> The target is unprotected by the Charm.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The target has limited access to the Princess’ Holy Shield. He takes the Aegis Tilt: each
    activation success each creates one shield-point which is equivalent to one Wisp spent on Holy Shield: A shield-point can be spent to downgrade Aggravated to Lethal damage, downgrade Lethal damage
    to Bashing damage, or negate all but the first point of Bashing damage. The Aegis may spend the
    same number of shield-points per turn as the caster’s Wisps per turn. The Tilt stacks with the innate
    Holy Shield if used on a Noble; both may be used against an attack.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success: Extra successes are their own reward.</i> 
</div>
<p><b>Upgrade: Queen's Guard</b><br>
    <b>Cost: </b>1 Wisp<br>

    in the current scene.</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Princess mishandles her power and injures herself. She takes 1 resistant lethal
    damage.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> The target is unprotected by the Charm.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The target takes the Lucky Escape Tilt. If the their last health box is filled with Lethal or
    Aggravated damage they replace that box with bashing Damage. This happens at the start of the
    target’s next turn.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> The last two Health boxes are affected.
</div>
<p><b>Upgrade: Collective</b><br>
    <b>Cost: </b>1 Wisp<br>
    The Princess may use the Charm on a social group that can see her, using the Commonalty modifier.
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Oaken Fortitude (Bless ••• Legno •)</button>
<div class="content">
<p><b>Action:</b> Instant<br>
<b>Dice Pool:</b> Strength + Medicine<br>
<b>Cost:</b> 1 Wisp<br>
<b>Duration:</b> 1 scene</p>

    gains the Temporary Health condition with one Health box per Success, this condition comes with the
    Healing modifier.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Jade Palm Strike (Bless ••• Terra ••)</button>
<div class="content">
<p><b>Action:</b> Instant<br>
<b>Dice Pool:</b> Presence + Expression<br>
<b>Cost:</b> 2 Wisps<br>
<b>Duration:</b> 1 scene</p>
<p>The Princess wraps a friend’s hands in a magical aura that mimics jade and cuts the flesh of servants
    of Darkness.</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The target’s arm turns into solid Jade. Take the Arm Wreck Tilt for the scene.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> For a moment, the target feels spiritually cleansed.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The target acquires the mystical purity of jade. His flesh has the same effects on creatures
    of Darkness that jade does until the Charm ends and he gains a bonus die to resist Dark magic. Jade
    Palm Strike cannot stack bonuses with physical jade.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> The target also gains the Blessing Condition and gains +2 dice to resist any
    Breaking Point caused by the Darkness.
</div>
<p><b>Upgrade: Armed</b><br>
    The target’s enchanted aura spreads to his weapons. A weapon in his hands acts on Dark creatures
as if made of jade. The aura comes from the target, not the weapon, so it fades from a weapon when
he releases it; however, it lingers long enough for a thrown object or a bullet to hit its target.
</p>
<p><b>Upgrade: Multiple</b><br>
    <b>Cost: </b>1 Willpower
    The Princess may give a jade aura to all the members of an organization in her presence, applying the

<b>Dice Pool:</b> Presence + Intimidation - target’s Composure<br>
<b>Cost:</b> 2 Wisps, 1 Willpower, Compromise at Belief 4+ with a -3 modifier<br>
<b>Duration:</b> 1 scene</p>
<p>The void can seep into every mind. Give in, it says. Do not resist. Give up, and let your sorrows drown
    you.</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Princess lets the void only into your own mind. She suffers from the Depression
    condition, it cannot be Resolved but fades on the next full moon.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> The power does not activate.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The stillness of the void settles into the heart and mind of a foe. The target gains the
    Condition Cursed, the affected trait is a Resistance Attribute of the Princess’ choice, which is decreased
    by the Princess’ activation successes. This Charm cannot reduce an attribute to zero dots.<br>
    If the last box on the target’s Health track fills with aggravated damage, the Charm ends and the
Condition is removed. When the Charm does end, the target’s Attributes return to their normal
values; all restored Health boxes are empty.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> Such a show of force terrifies the foe, showing them the foolishness of standing
    up to the Princess. In addition to the other effects, he suffers from the Depression Condition until the
    next time he sees the sun.

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Peaceable Kingdom (Bless ••••• Legno ••••)</button>
<div class="content">
<p><b>Action:</b> Instant<br>
<b>Dice Pool:</b> Intelligence + Animal Ken<br>
<b>Cost:</b> 3 Wisps, 1 Willpower<br>
<b>Duration:</b> 1 scene</p>
<p>The Queen of Clubs’ avatar is guardian and teacher of the beasts. The Princess undergoes a second
    transformation on activating the Charm, assuming traits that suggest a large and powerful animal –
    typically a lion, though bear-like and eagle-like miens are known, and there are rumors of one Hopeful
    who evokes a dragon. The change always suggests a king or queen of beasts, and the peril and majesty
    of the natural world; any mortal seeing the Princess is somewhat shaken, and she gains +1 on all
    Intimidation rolls against them until the Charm ends.</p>
<p>However, the main effect of the Charm is on beasts who see it. Any natural animal that can perceive
    the Princess when she activates the Charm has its Intelligence raised by 1 dot, becoming sapient. Further,
    the animals affected gain instant fluency in her native language, and the Charm grants them the ability
    to speak it comprehensibly if they have any ability to vocalize at all. The Princess may use Social
    Skills on the animals as she would with mortals, and gains a bonus on such rolls equal to her activation
    successes. When the Charm ends, the animals return to their former non-sapient state. If the Princess
    use the Charm twice on the same animal, it remembers everything that happened during the first use.</p>
<p>Until the Charm ends, the Princess gains the Invocation Lock condition keyed to Legno.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Sheltered by Her Hand (Bless ••••• Lacrima ••••)</button>
<div class="content">
<p><b>Action:</b> Instant<br>
<b>Dice Pool:</b> Resolve + Empathy, modified by Commonalty<br>
<b>Cost:</b> 1 Wisp, 1 Willpower, Compromise at Belief 4+ with a -3 modifier<br>
<b>Duration:</b> 1 scene</p>
<p>To preserve her city and her subjects is the first principle of the Queen of Tears, and those who incarnate
    her are able to guard their allies from all harm. A Princess uses this Charm to protect citizens of Alhambra
    (no other Commonality group may be used; Lacrima may not be magically linked to Alhambra, but the
    avatar of Alhambra’s Lady certainly is).</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Princess fails utterly to protect her allies, and is crushed. She looses a point of
    Willpower and cannot spend or regain Willpower for the rest of the scene. In other words, she gains
    the Depression Condition but automatically suffers it’s full effects without needing to fail in her goals
    first.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> The Princess cannot protect her allies. The Charm fails.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The Princess undergoes a second transformation that drains all the colour from her body and
    Regalia. All members of the target group who can see this transformation feel a breath of cold pass
    over them, penetrating through all clothing for a moment.<br>
    Until the Charm ends, the transformation expands and substantially modifies the Princess’ Holy Shield;
creating the Sheltering Hand Tilt: When anyone affected takes damage the Princess automatically
protects them by spending Wisps at her usual rate for Holy Shield. If she does not have sufficient
Wisps she drains the land around her, for each Wisp drained roll one die and create a point of Taint
per Success.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> The Princess touches the determination that has sustained the Queen of Tears
    in her mission. She also gains the Blessing Condition. The affected trait is Inner Strength rolls and
    the increase is 2. The Blessing ends when the Sheltering Hand Tilt does so.
</div>
<p><b>Drawback: </b>The Queen of Tears perpetually mourns for the lost Kingdom, and the sacrifices that must
    be made to sustain its remnant; her avatar bears the burden of her grief, and so also gains the Queen’s
    Grief Tilt. At the end of every turn where she protected someone with this Charm roll Resolve +
    Composure:<br>
    <div class="failsucc">
        <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The princess collapses into a hysterical mess for the scene, and suffers all
        accumulated Depression.<br>
        <i>Failure:</i> The Princess takes a -1 penalty to all future Resolve + Composure rolls to maintain Sheltered
        by Her Hand for this scene. In addition she adds one day of Depression to her accumulated total.<br>
        <i>Success:</i> The Princess takes a -1 penalty to all future Resolve + Composure rolls to maintain Sheltered
        by Her Hand for this scene.<br>
        <i>Exceptional Success:</i> Nothing happens.
    </div>
    When the Charm ends the Princess mediately falls into Depression for the number of days accumulated
during this Charm.</p>
    <p>Until the Charm ends, the Princess gains the Invocation Lock condition keyed to Lacrima.</p>
