<div id=Umbrae class="tabcontent">
<p>The following list of Umbrae should not be taken as comprehensive; the Darkness has many ways to
    distort its servants. Each Umbra confers a benefit, balanced by a drawback.</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Animate Shadow</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Your shadow has developed a mind of it’s own and serves you as a familiar. A Shadow is statted out
            as a normal person, with at least 1 dot in each Attribute plus extra dots allocated 5/4/3 and Skill dots
            allocated 9/6/3. Its Size is the same as the person casting it, and its Willpower, Initiative and Speed
            are calculated as for a normal person of its type. The Shadow can not speak as a normal person would
            and it’s actions seem to make less noise than it would. The Shadow’s default shape is a silhouette of a
            person. A Shadow moves by crawling along the ground or across the walls, but always remains attached
            to the feet.</p>
        <p>Shadows are naturally stealthy and gain 8again on both Larceny rolls and Stealth rolls to avoid
            being noticed as anything but a normal shadow. Though Animated Shadows are easy to destroy, never
            having more than three Health Boxes, only jade or magical weapons can affect them. If destroyed they
            will naturally reform after around ten minuets. Shadows automatically gain any Caligo or Umbrae
            possessed by the Darkened that changes the body’s shape such as most Claudendum Caligines, think
            literally: if the Darkend’s shadow looks differently the Shadow share’s the benefits. There is one
            exception: Shadows may never gain Armour.</p>
        <p><b>Drawback: </b>Your shadow really does have a mind of it’s own, and seeks out opportunities to indulge it’s
            Vice. Being a shadow it is limited but makes up for that by stooping to rather petty levels. The Shadow
            of a greedy man will swipe loose change. The Shadow of a lusty woman will take any opportunity to
            pinch a cute hunk’s bum. If the character is paying attention they may roll Composure to restrain their
            Shadow.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Cold Flesh</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The Darkened’s skin turns cold, as if they have poor circulation. They are now immune to all negative
            modifiers for low temperature, and will not suffer hypothermia or frostbite, no matter how low the
            temperature gets.</p>
        <p><b>Drawback: </b>The sun’s touch is now painful against their chilled skin. They take 1 point of bashing
            damage every 5 minutes from direct sunlight, manifesting as severe sunburn. Completely covering up
            and use of strong suncream can reduce this to one point every 15 minutes.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Corruption of Blood</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The character’s blood, spittle and sweat are laced with necrotic fluids. He need only touch someone
            barehanded to inflict a moderate Sick Tilt [GMC 212]; if he injures someone with his natural weapons
            (even bashing damage) he inflicts a grave Sick Tilt. Moreover, when the Sick Tilt ends (or immediately,
            outside of combat) an infectee must roll Stamina + Resolve, penalized by the Darkened’s Shadows (for a
            moderate sickness) or the Darkened’s Shadows + Stamina (for a grave one) once an hour to avoid taking
            lethal damage equal to the character’s Shadows, a number of times equal to the Darkened’s Stamina.</p>
        <p>Though the source of the sickness is supernatural the sickness itself is not, and responds normally to
            medical intervention.</p>
        <p><b>Drawback: </b>The character’s fluids are always necrotic. He cannot touch anyone without infecting them.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Corruption of Flesh</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The Taint on the character’s soul is only attached by the thinnest of threads, it is eager to go forth and
            corrupt the world. Every time it leaves, it carries a bit of it’s host away.</p>
        <p>When ever the character kills a mortal human he loses a Dot of Shadows, Intelligence or Stamina
            (in that order), this dot is consumed by the darkness within his soul in order to pollute the body of his
            victim. The body then rises as a fresh Darkspawn.</p>
        <p>Darkspawn created through Corruption of Flesh have all the Umbrae known to their creator as well
            as any Claudendum Caligines. The only exception is the Umbrae Subsumed by Another Shadow. Not
            only does the freshly risen Darkspawn lack Subsumed by Another Shadow, it also begins it’s unlife
            loyal to it’s creator.</p>
        <p><b>Drawback: </b>The Drawback is the lost Attribute dots. Most Darkened with this Umbrae tend to rot
            away as their Stamina is consumed.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Cruel Confidence</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The darkness warped personality of the character inflates ego, conceals weaknesses, and buries their fears
            and compassion deep inside their suffering heart. Other people become tools, their dreams exist for them
            to abuse.</p>
        <p>While the ability is in effect, the threshold to open the Character’s doors through Intimidate,
            Persuasion or Socialize actions is doubled, while they gain +1 bonus to rolls for all the above.</p>
        <p><b>Drawback: </b>Though the character is confident on the surface, they are only delusional, and disconnected,
            ignoring their pain while it eats them away. They are under constant stress with no apparent source(to
            them), becoming impulsive and irritable. Furthermore, they can’t gain the Swooning condition, as they
            are “superior” to everyone, and can’t roll Empathy, as they are convinced they “don’t care what anyone
            else feels’” even when they feel concerned.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Dark Dreams</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The Darkness is everywhere there is sin or vice or absence, and some of this knowledge is fed into the
            Darkened’s brain. The Darkened gains the White Rabbits Merit, at 1 dot. On any night they use the
            merit, they do not regain Willpower.</p>
        <p><b>Drawback: </b>There are three potential drawbacks for this Umbra. Dark Dreams can be taken up to
            3 times, each time increasing the level of the Dream Merit by 2 dots, to a maximum of 5, and taking
            another drawback.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The eyes of the Darkened cloud over with cataracts that surgery can do nothing for. They gain
                the Blind Condition.</li>
            <li>The taint of the Darkness seeps into their mind. They are at -1 to all later Breaking Point rolls.</li>
            <li>The dreams come unwillingly, and every night. As a result, the Darkened never regains Willpower
                from sleeping again. This does not increase the frequency of useful dreams.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Faceless in the Crowd</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The Darkness begins to subsume the Darkened’s identity. People just ignore them. All individuals are
            at -3 to even notice them, and must roll Intelligence + Composure each time they want to remember
            them, failure producing a description of “Well... he... I think it was a he... was sort of tall? Maybe?”
            Mechanical and electronic records are not affected.</p>
        <p><b>Drawback: </b>This applies to all rolls to notice or remember the Darkened ... not just their present
            life, but their past deeds, before they gained this Umbra. Childhood friends forget their names, old
            acquaintances don’t recognize their faces, neighbors are startled on noticing them in a home they’ve
            owned for years.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Grip Onto Your Fear</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The flimsiest Darkspawn’s grip can become the unheeding grasp of death once it locks its palm around
            you, and woe to the ones who panic, for the darkness feeds off of their despair. When the character is in
            a grapple, he gains a +2 bonus to the Hold and Restrain moves. Against an opponent with a Condition
            or Tilt that implies fear, such as Shaken, the bonus is +3. In actions that involve gripping an object,
            the character gains a +1 bonus, and attempts to remove an object from his grasp take a -1 penalty.</p>
        <p><b>Drawback: </b>The character’s hands, while normal to the eye, are repulsive to the touch. His palm could
            always be sticky with sweat, rough as if covered in wood chips or cold as ice. Only thick gloves can stop
            the sensation of disgust in those he touches. In any Social rolls against a person the character has ever
            put a hand on, he suffers a -2 penalty; in social manoeuvres against such people, the character must
            open one extra Door.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Hollow as a Shadow</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The Darkened becomes hollow and empty within, with effort they can twist themselves to become
            hollow and empty without as well. The Darkened can rolling Stamina + Composure to shift between
            one of three states: Solid, intangible and Twilight. This takes an Instant action. It is not uncommon
            for Darkspawn with this Umbrae to forget how to become solid. No matter what state the Darkened is
            in, they take full damage from Jade.</p>
        <p><b>Drawback: </b>When you’re hollow you’re hollow. The Darkened always feels unsubstantial, like they
            have little to offer and don’t belong. Their default state is intangible. In any stressful social situation
            where others are not directly paying attention to you, such as preparing to enter an interview room, the
            Darkened must roll Composure, on a failure they shift into Twilight and must remain there for the rest
            of the scene.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Hunger Means Nothing</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The Darkened is now immune to deprivation from dehydration or hunger. They no longer need to eat,
            nor drink; though they can, they gain no benefit from it, nor do they taste anything.</p>
        <p><b>Drawback: </b>Quite apart from the fact that they can never eat again, the character wastes away. They
            are at a permanent -1 to all actions from the weakness and slowness of thought, they reduce their Health
            by one box, and look too thin, like a cancer patient, or (some more cynical Princesses might remark) a
            top fashion model.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Name</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Every Princess who knows of this Umbrae agrees that it has one and only one positive side. It’s rare.</p>
        <p>Infectious Hate allows a Creature of the Darkness to inflict the Darkened template upon innocent
            mortals. As with the usual way that the Darkness infects innocent victims, the target must suffer a
            Breaking Point and lose Integrity. Shortly before, during, or after the Breaking Point the Creature with
            this Umbrae must tell the target why they are a bad person (this requirement means that Darkspawn
            with the Umbrae are often incapable of using it). There is no controlling the Umbrae, if you have
            Shadows and accuse someone in a moment of vulnerability the Umbrae takes effect.</p>
        <p>Spend a Dot of Shadows and roll Presence + Intimidation - Integrity</p>
        <div class="failsucc">
            <i>Exceptional Success:</i> The target gains the Darkened template and an Umbrae.<br>
            <i>Success:</i> The target gains the Shrouded condition (if they do not have it) and one point of Nox per
            success. If they gain Darkened template, they also gain an Umbrae.<br>
            <i>Failure:</i> The dot of Shadows is wasted.<br>
            <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> Hate drips off the Creature’s words. Everyone who hears them sees the Creature
            as a bigot of the worst kind.
        </div>
        <p>Umbrae inflicted by Infectious Hate don’t manifest immediately but develop over around ten hours,
            they develop much faster during night. While the Creature has no control over what Umbrae are
            developed they often, but not always, thematically reflect the accusations. A Darkened manager who
            fires his employee, inflicting a Breaking Point, and calls him a leech who profits of his coworker’s hard
            work might create the Thief’s Touch or the Loathsome Jaw Umbrae with a horrifying leach-like mouth.</p>
        <p><b>Drawback: </b>Before you can infect people with your hate, you must first possess hate. When acquiring
            this Umbrae Creatures gain the Obsession Condition, which cannot be resolved without removing the Umbrae. The obsession, of course, reflects their drive to destroy people who fall under whatever category
            they hate, though they may put a more noble sounding euphemism around it. Many Darkened with
            this Umbrae begin by inflicting their curse and then deciding that the monstrous form inflicted by their
            victim’s new Umbrae “proves them right” and justifies more drastic action. Other creatures of the
            Darkness don’t need a justification.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Loathsome Weapon</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Part of the Darkened’s body transforms into a lethal weapon - his mouth grows into a muzzle full of
            fangs, or his fingers stiffen into knife-like claws. Attacks with the altered body inflict Shadows damage,
            maximum of 5. The Darkened need not grapple to attack with the altered part, even if that would be
            necessary before the alteration (as bites often are.) A Darkened may take multiple Loathsome
            Weapons, with each one affecting a different part of his body.</p>
        <p><b>Drawback: </b>The body part cannot be used for anything but attacking foes while it is changed: a
            Darkened with a changed mouth cannot speak intelligibly, one with changed hands cannot grasp or
            manipulate objects. Naturally if the Darkened cannot hide his weapon people will react appropriately.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Light is Dark</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The Darkened’s eyes transform; he now sees by the absence of light. Complete darkness is for him what
            bright light is for normal people, and he suffers no penalty from low light.</p>
        <p><b>Drawback: </b>Contrariwise, bright light is to him what complete darkness is for normal people – the
            Darkened is blind when directly illuminated, and takes penalties for any task that requires looking at
            things that give off light. Darkened with this Umbra are forced into a largely nocturnal existence.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Miasma of Madness</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The Darkened exudes a colorless, odorless mist with a radius of Presence + Shadows. Anyone
            breathing in the mist must make a Resolve + Composure roll to prevent the mist from clouding their
            mind for the rest of the scene. Any one affected suffers from the a Tilt for the rest of the scene. The
            exact Tilt varies by the individual Creature.</p>
        <p><b>Drawback: </b>The Darkened must make the same roll or spend a Willpower point every scene.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Scuttling Spider's Sense</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The character becomes hypersensitive to sounds and changes in air-pressure, so sensitive that they gain
            a kind of limited precognition. The character may apply their full Defence to ranged attacks, moving to
            dodge bullets before the trigger is pulled.</p>
        <p><b>Drawback: </b>People move constantly in a hundred small ways, every twitch, every breath could be a threat
            and the character can’t keep up with all of them. When in the same room with more than Composure
            people the Darkened starts to get panicky. After Resolve minutes he must spend a Willpower, run for
            somewhere alone (and stay there for at least ten minuets) or violently lash out at the threats.</p>
        <p>The lifeless Creatures of the Darkness, even Darkened, do not trigger this instinctive panic even
            though they are far more likely to commit casual violence upon their own kind.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Sight in Blackest Night</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The character gains the ability to navigate clearly by sound alone. They take no perception penalties
            for Darkness or other related penalties.</p>
        <p><b>Drawback: </b>At the cost of their vision. As a general rule their new hearing can substitute for sight
            but automatically fails any roll that requires sight, such as reading. Deafening noise can be completely
            debilitating.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Sound of Silence</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The character’s hearing becomes exceptionally acute. They gain +3 to all aural based rolls.</p>
        <p><b>Drawback: </b>So acute, in fact, that they are pained by voices, even their own. The many subtleties and
            emotions in speech are overwhelming to their sensitive ears. They cannot speak above the level of a soft
            whisper. This, as might be guessed, makes day-to-day life rather hard. They cannot drive a motorcycle,
            or attend concerts while in this state. Should they go to a supermarket, they must use the self-checkout,
            to avoid clamorous small talk with the girl at the checkout counter. All social rolls conducted at a normal
            volume take a -3 penalty. Insisting on whispering can impose penalties of it’s own.</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Subsumed By Another Shadow</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Whenever the Creature comes within (Willpower + number of Umbrae) yards of a Darkspawn (and not
            other Creatures of the Darkness), he reflexively and automatically rolls Presence + Resolve, contested by
            the Resolve + Composure of the Darkspawn. The Creature makes this roll separately for each Darkspawn
            he meets, but no more often than once a scene. If the Creature gets more successes, the Darkspawn
            believes him to be its natural superior, and will seek to protect him as best it can, and gratify what it
            thinks are his desires.</p>
        <p>The duration of this effect depends on what kind of creature possesses the Umbrae. A Darkened or
            Darkspawn will assert domimence until it’s servant separated for Shadows hours. A Mnemosyne retains
            control for Willpower + Shadows hours. Cataphractoi, for whom this umbrae is a fundamental part of
            their being, retain control for one week per dot of Shadows. After the duration expires the Darkspawn
            forgets it’s master’s existence.</p>
        <p>The Creature can try to give his servant an order as an instant action; the dice pool is Presence +
            Composure, and the order can have no more than (successes) conditions (so, “Break the light” is one,
            while “Break the light outside” is two.) By default, a Darkspawn servant will also use all its
            powers/abilities to prevent others from seeing it, but it will break cover if an order requires it. The one
            order it won’t obey is to leave and not return.</p>
        <p><b>Drawback: </b>Of course, most people don’t really want vicious Darkness-beasts following them around.
            Darkspawn servants consistently assume that their master wants them to do harm, and will kill or wreck
            anything that seems to be an obstacle, or even inconvenience. A Darkspawn sent to buy groceries will
            attempt to pay, but if the cashier takes too long with the change, says it’s not enough money or more
            likely tries to lock the door as soon as she sees a monster approaching, then the Darkspawn will probably
            try to kill her.</p>
        <p>Any expression of dislike for somebody, even for a trivial reason (being pushed aside by a passing
            stranger, say) might inspire the Darkspawn to deliver his severed head to your doorstep. In addition,
            most Darkspawn aren’t the prettiest of things, and being followed by monsters that don’t seem to show
            themselves to others is quite nasty on the psyche.</p>
        <p>Darkspawn that possess this Umbrae are immune to its effects; they are not going to serve another,
            and will often attack anyone or anything else which possesses it. Moreover, they seem prone to retaining
            a worrying cunning quite unlike human intelligence; the limited use of language (enough to call out “help
            me” in a normal voice while trying to lure someone in), tactics (send weaker ones to make a noise outside
            while it and the stronger ones it controls come in through the roof), and the ability to control other
            Darkspawn make them notably more dangerous, especially since there is no way, on sight, to tell them
            apart.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Subtle Tongue</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Devious cunning becomes easy for the Darkened, as the nothingness and antipathy for form of the
            Darkness enters through the mouth. All Manipulation-based rolls, except for activations of
            supernatural powers, are at +1; this is increased to +3 if the character is lying.</p>
        <p><b>Drawback: </b>Correspondingly, forthright openness becomes hard. All Presence-based rolls, again except
            for activations of supernatural powers, are automatically reduced to a chance die; on a Dramatic Failure,
            the target becomes convinced that the Darkened is lying to them.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Tainted Allure of Vice</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>There is something... fascinating about the Creature of the Darkness which calls to mortal souls; a sick,
            degrading allure to its presence which draws others closer. The character gains the Striking Looks
            merit, at the 2 dot rating, as the entire way they move, speak, act becomes attractive, even if they do
            not change much physically. Darkspawn with this Umbra retain some allure and do not become ugly,
            instead gaining a beauteous depravity in their inhumanity.</p>
        <p><b>Drawback: </b>... and it brings out the worst in others, for it is a guilty pleasure that wracks at the soul.
            At the time of purchase, the Creature chooses a Vice such as Cruel, Violent, Lustful. As soon as they
            use the bonus dice from Striking Looks on a person (which is not a choice), for all future interactions
            that individual gains the Vice as a secondary Vice along the lines of “Cruel towards that Darkened” (if
            it is redundant with an existing Vice there is no further benefit). The Vice can only restore Willpower if
            indulgence harms, subjugates, or degrades the Creature of the Darkness in some way, and will likely be
            a Breaking Point for any moral person. In packs of Darkspawn, ones with this Umbra are right at the
            bottom of the pack, because they suffer the indignities of their “peers” just as much as they had in life.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Taste of Sin</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The Darkened may assess a character’s morality with a Wits + Empathy roll. This is phrased in terms
            of the worst sins that the character has no problem with (so, for example, “This character has no issues
            with non-lethal violence against his fellow man”). On an exceptional success, he also knows the worst
            action the individual has committed. Moreover they get +2 on social rolls if the target has the
            Vice-Ridden Merit.</p>
        <p><b>Drawback: </b>... and the consequence is that the virtuous are painful to be around. They have a -2 to
            social rolls against people with the Virtuous Merit, the Beacon Merit, or Princesses with a Beleif of 7+.
            Moreover, they need to pass a Resolve + Composure at the same penalty to even talk to people with
            such a moral nature; if they fail, they lose a Willpower point, as a sudden shame hits them.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Thief's Touch</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The character’s fingers are quicker and more nimble, subtly guiding the character in dark deeds. They
            gain the 8-again bonus in all Larceny and Subterfuge and rolls</p>
        <p><b>Drawback: </b>The character is always the first to be suspected of any wrong doing, even if he made a
            clean getaway or is innocent.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Roteater</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The character can eat anything, up to and including broken glass, and will suffer no more than one
            point of bashing damage as the “food” goes down. Anything less resilient than metal will be digested;
            things undigested will be passed, again causing no more than 1 point of bashing damage. They also 
            receive a dot in the Hardy merit for free, ignoring the normal prerequisites for it.</p>
        <p><b>Drawback: </b></p>
